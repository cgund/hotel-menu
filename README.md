# hotel-menu

It does pretty much what youâ€™d expect.  A restaurant customer selects an item(s) off the menu.  Those items are added to the order pane and the total is updated.  Once added, the customer can also remove the item or adjust the quantity.  When ready to order, the customer enters personal information.  There is some input validation that occurs before the order can be processed.  Once the order is placed, a new window displays an order confirmation and allows the user to print the details.  This application was written for a data structures course assignment.
